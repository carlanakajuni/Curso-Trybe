        <h4>Whales</h4>
        <p>...are awesome because they are beautiful animals, theyâ€™re <em>elegant</em> and <strong>strong</strong>. Whales are gentle creatures that <em><strong>need protecting</strong></em>. Whales have a big heart, literally and figuratively. They have been known to adopt dolphins when they are abandoned from their own pods. Belugas, Humpbacks and Bowhead whales are three of the most interesting whales.</p>
